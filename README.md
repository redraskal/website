# redraskal.sh / ctos.sh

This is the source code to my [personal website](https://redraskal.sh). I use my own web framework for Bun, [gateway](https://github.com/redraskal/gateway).

## To install dependencies:

```bash
bun i
```

## To generate a route:

```bash
bun gen {name}

bun gen test
# or
bun gen test.ts
# 📝 pages/test.ts created.
```

The new route will automatically open in Visual Studio Code.

## To run a development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

## To run a production server:

```bash
bun start
```

This project was created with [Bun](https://bun.sh), a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
